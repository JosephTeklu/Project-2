## Description

This project allows a user to enter in a long url and gets a shortened version back. We did this because we are used to sending links to people all the time and don't enjoy when they are really long and take up space, with this project we are able to solve that problem. Through this project we were able to learn a lot about full stack development and working on everything from the back end and front end using api's and reciving user input and giving an outcome.
